How about the sensation of moving Mario left and right, of jumping, colliding with blocks, stomping Goombas? What does it feel like to control Mario? Go watch someone unfamiliar with games—your mom, perhaps—try to play a game like Rad Racer. If it’s a game which requires real-time control, she’ll be leaning left and right in her chair, pulling the controller, trying to get the car to move just a bit farther, a bit faster. Ever seen someone do this? Done it yourself? This feeling of steering—this tactile, visceral sensation—is game feel."

      "text": "For the purposes of this book, “feel” is meant in a very specific sense relevant to the experience of playing video games. Feel is not meant in the thematic sense (a Western feel, a Baroque feel) or in the expressive, emotional or physical sense (I feel sad, I feel pain, this place feels creepy). Specifically, game feel is the tactile, kinesthetic sense of manipulating a virtual object. It’s the sensation of control in a game."

      "text": "In digital game design, feel is the elephant in the room. Players know it. Designers know of it. Nobody talks about it, and everybody takes it for granted. It’s not hard to understand why; if a game designer’s done his or her job correctly, the player will never notice the feel of a game. It will just seem right. In this sense, game feel is an “invisible art,” like cinematography. Feel is the most overlooked aspect of game creation; a powerful, gripping, tactile sensation that exists somewhere in the space between player and game. It is a kind of “virtual sensation,” a blending of the visual, aural and tactile. In short, it is one of the most powerful properties of human-computer interaction."

      "text": "Recently, I had the opportunity to play Spacewar!, the world’s first video game¹ at the “Game On!” exhibit at the Tech Museum, in San Jose, California. What struck me is just how compelling the game still is. It’s easy to imagine the breathless enthusiasm of the young technicians crowding around their PDP-1 supercomputer, exhausting hours of valuable computing time on endless rounds of Steve Russell’s creation. Even today, as a product of a video game culture, having played hundreds of games, it feels great to me to steer the little rockets, fire off missiles and avoid black holes. Game feel has been with us since the beginning."

      "text": "It may be easy to bring to mind, but game feel is difficult to understand. Games are a nascent and complex medium, one which incorporates many previous forms. A single game might include painting, music, cinematography, writing and animation."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If that weren’t enough, video games represent an unprecedented collaboration between creator and consumer. We abdicate authorial control to our players and get … something. We’re not quite sure what yet, but we know that it has potential. To many, interactivity seems to be the most important medium of the 21st century."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "It’s surprising, then, that the luminaries of digital game design have devoted little ink to the phenomenon of feel. In Rollings and Morris, any mention of feel is conspicuously absent. Salen and Zimmerman dance tantalizingly close to discussing feel, but take a more holistic approach, focusing on game state at the higher intervals where scoring and more traditional strategic considerations occur. Chris Crawford’s revered work, The Art of Computer Game Design, devotes only a sentence to game feel, saying “The input structure is the player’s tactile contact with the game; people attach deep significance to touch, so touch must be a rewarding experience for them.”"

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "With due respect to these authors and all the great stuff they have taught us, what’s missing is an appreciation of just how unique and beautiful an aesthetic game feel truly is. It exists outside of video games—driving cars, riding bikes and so on—but nowhere is it so refined, pure and malleable."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In addition, game feel is moment-to-moment interaction. If we examine the functional underpinnings of most video games, there is usually game feel at the most basic level. It has greater importance in certain games but it’s always there. As a percentage of activities in the game, it’s what you spend most of your time experiencing. If you break down all the activities of a game, it’s the biggest slice of the pie."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This book is about examining feel in greater detail. Where does it come from? How is it created? Does it exist in the computer, the player’s mind or somewhere in between? What are the different kinds of feel and why do they feel the way they do? In a clear, non-technical style intended to be accessible to professionals, players and aspiring designers alike, we will investigate feel as experienced by players, created by designers and measured by psychologists. The goal is to create a comprehensive guide to game feel: deconstructing it, classifying it, measuring it and creating it. By book’s end you will have the tools to measure, master and create exemplary game feel."

So many creative ideas rely on a foundation of good-feeling controls. It should be a given that we can always create controls that feel good. We shouldn’t have to start from scratch every time."

In the examples you can see all the tiny decisions and particulars of implementation that go into making games feel the way they do. This is the palette of game feel; if you want to make good-feeling games, these are the details you need to understand."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If you’re a game designer, the definition stuff will not be news to you. But some of the theory bits may be useful and applicable, if only to better understand the deeper physiological phenomena. The examples will be useful because of the legwork I’ve already done—you can reverse engineer games yourself, probably, but it takes a lot of time. The principles of game feel may also be a useful way to think about building games. It’s one way, at any rate, to which you can compare your own methods.²"

      "text": "If you’re someone interested in the medium of games, such as a journalist, the definition parts may provide a new perspective on genres. In addition, understanding the physiological thresholds that cause game feel to be sustained or break down may help explain why frame rate drops and other technical disturbances make games feel so much worse. But my hope is that in understanding and being able to measure things like frame rate and response time, you will be able to do a better job of separating medium from message. Yes, a developer is to blame if a game runs poorly. But I think this consideration is given too superlative an emphasis when games are critiqued. The experience of playing a game may still have some things to offer from a critical standpoint—as Jurassic Park: Trespasser did—even if they are technically incompetent."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Each of the three parts of the definition is expanded to make it useful for classifying games as well as understanding what game feel is. Expanding the definition requires an exploration of some of the ways people perceive things, including measures for frame rate, response time and other conditions necessary for game feel to occur. These physiological thresholds and concepts of perception combine to form the “game feel model for interactivity”—a complete picture of the ongoing process of game feel."

      "text": "Another problem facing game designers is meaningful comparison. How does the feel of Halo compare to the feel of Ikaruga? From a designer’s perspective, this is tied to tuning. Why is one game “floaty” while another is “tight and responsive”? If a player tells me that my game is floaty, what should I do? How should I change the variables of my complex system? Is floaty bad? Is it good? What does it mean?"
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This section is about measuring the pieces of the game feel process that a designer can change. By measuring each piece—input, response, context, polish, metaphor and rules—we can make generalizations about what terms like floaty, tight, smooth, responsive and loose mean. Not only in a particular game, but across different games. Once we can measure game feel, we can master it."

With deep, expressive interactivity, can we provide experiences which don’t require the backdrop of skill and challenge? Is it possible to express things spatially without competition? Could game feel be a form of deeply personal expression like dance or martial arts?"
