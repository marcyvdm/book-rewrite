# The Three Building Blocks of Game Feel

Game feel, as experienced by players, is built from three parts: real-time control,
simulated space and polish.

## Real-Time Control

Real-time control is a specific form of interactivity. Like all interactivity, it includes
at least two participants—in this case the computer and the user—who come
together to form a closed loop, as illustrated in  Figure 1.1 , the concept couldn’t be
simpler.
The user has some intent, which is expressed to the computer in the form of the
user’s input. The computer reconciles this input with its own internal model and
outputs the results. The user then perceives the changes, thinks about how they
compare to the original intent, and formulates a new action, which is expressed to
the computer through another input.
