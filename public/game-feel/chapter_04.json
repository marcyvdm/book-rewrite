If we take the building blocks of game feel from Chapter 1, plus the five experiences of game feel we categorized, and add them to the interactivity diagram from Chapter 2, with its three human processors (perceptual, cognitive and motor), we have a model of game feel that looks like Figure 3.1."

      "text": "The perceptual field is your constructed model of objective reality, of the “real” world around you. It provides the background for perception, whether in the game or in the real world. Shimmers of former experiences, skills learned, ideas, generalizations, thoughts, concepts, fantasies and misconceptions all form the construct within which perception occurs. Sometimes, when it’s clear your perceptual field is inadequate to deal with a particular situation, you consciously reflect on your understanding of the world around you in an effort to expand your perceptual field. You try to find the holes in your comprehensive model of objective reality. This can be a pleasurable process, as when you undergo a paradigm shift to solve a puzzle, or a stressful one, such as when you lose your keys in the sofa."

      "text": "The game world is a simplified subdomain of the real world. Your brain substitutes the stimuli it’s getting back from the game world for those it normally gets from the real world. This includes sights, sounds, tactile sensation such as controller rumble and joystick or button push-back and the proprioceptive feedback it gets from the position of your fingers on the input device. All this feedback is extrapolated to a mental construct of the microworld represented by the game. This is an abridged, simplified version of the process by which you experience, learn about and cope with the physical world around you. As such, it includes not only the tactile, visual and aural experience of exploring the game world, but the higher-level implications of those experiences. For example, if my character always falls back to the ground after jumping, I assume there is some kind of gravity. If my character runs into things instead of passing through them, I assume those things are solid. As in the real world, simple interactions yield a wealth of"

Perception requires action, as we’ve said, and all perception of a game world must pass through the avatar."

It is perceived at a cycle time between 50 and 200ms, depending on individual and circumstance. If two stimuli are perceived within the same perceptual cycle, they appear fused, as with multiple frames of an animation fusing into a single, moving character. If an action passes out through the motor processor and the response is perceived in the same perceptual frame, there is a strong bias toward experiencing action and response as causal (“My action caused this result”)."

As this process is running, the perceptual field is in the background coloring, ordering and assigning meaning to all new experiences. As soon as the experience happens, it is incorporated into the perceptual field, expanding it. Skills are built, memories are formed, life is lived."

All intent passes through the filter of the input device before it can be interpreted by the system and used to update the state of the computer’s model of the game’s reality, which is different from the player’s. The motivation and experience of the player are more complicated than this in many ways, but if the goal is to better understand the pieces of game feel that are malleable to the game designer, it’s convenient to think in these simplified terms. The player has a particular intent at a given moment in time, and he or she expresses that intent to the system via the input device. Whatever the input device is, it has affordances and constraints. It will lend itself to controlling certain kinds of motion more readily than others and has its own physical feel and character which will ultimately affect the experience of game feel as perceived by the player."

It accepts input at a certain rate, thinks about it for a certain amount of time, and then responds, sending signals to its output devices. As with the human processors, the computer has a cycle time for this whole endeavor. In the case of the computer, though, the response needs to happen quickly enough for the player to perceive the response as instantaneous—within one perceptual cycle (as little as 50ms) of receiving input from the player."

The computer needs to perform its half of the cycle faster than the player can perceive. If this occurs, the player will see the series of incrementally changed visual frames as a single moving object and will feel it reacting immediately to the input. The player will readily interpret a cause and effect relationship, and the impression of control is complete."

The monitor and speakers are where the processing of the computer reaches reality. They are the computer’s organs of expression to the player. The completed processes have resulted in an updated system state for the computer, and it sends visual, aural and tactile feedback out through its various channels into the world and, as we looked at in Chapter 1, the position of the hands or other body parts on the input device offers the player proprioceptive feedback which can be reconciled with what’s happening on the screen or coming through the speakers. Moving my thumb this far moves the character too fast, so I subconsciously ease off the thumbstick by a millimeter or two."

This question is perhaps more satisfying as applied to game worlds because it can be answered definitively. Intent in a game world is designed by a game’s creator; we don’t have to wonder at its origins, divine or otherwise. As for real-world intention, French Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty thinks that people have an “in-born intentionality towards the world.” To say: “we’re born with it,’” though, seems like a bit of a cop-out."

At the bottom are things like satisfying your basic physical needs for food, shelter and warmth. Moving up, you find security, love, self-esteem and, finally, self-actualization. The idea is that at any time, if one of the lower rungs is unsatisfied, consciousness dips down to that base level until that need is sated. People are constantly trying to reach higher and higher on the pyramid, striving for creative satisfaction and whatnot. Sims, it seems, have a hard time getting above the toilet level."

This is one of the dark arts of game design—creating meaningful, compelling intent from a seemingly arbitrary collection of abstracted variables. Think, for example, of the coins in Super Mario 64. Ask yourself: if you didn’t get a star for collecting 100 coins or if they did not restore Mario’s health, would you bother collecting them? No, of course not. These are the arbitrary relationships between abstract variables that give coins meaning in the game world of Mario 64. The star itself is given meaning only by being rare and powerful, one of only 120 in the whole game, each of which is a clear, measurable step toward unlocking the entirety of the game’s levels, the (explicit) goal of defeating Bowser or the (implicit) goal of collecting all the stars."

A game world’s logic is simple, easy to understand, and provides clear incentives, rewards and feedback for effort invested. It’s safer than the chaotic and arbitrary nature of everyday life. It’s comforting. In many cases, it rewards mediocrity or at least makes it ignorable. Whether this is good or bad is a different question, but it is worth noting that most game worlds do in fact have in-born intentionality, and it’s the game designer who creates it."
