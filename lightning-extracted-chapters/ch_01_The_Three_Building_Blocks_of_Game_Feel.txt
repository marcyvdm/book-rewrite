# The Three Building Blocks of Game Feel\n\nGame feel, as experienced by players, is built from three parts: real-time control,\nsimulated space and polish.\n\n## Real-Time Control\n\nReal-time control is a specific form of interactivity. Like all interactivity, it includes\nat least two participants—in this case the computer and the user—who come\ntogether to form a closed loop, as illustrated in  Figure 1.1 , the concept couldn’t be\nsimpler.\nThe user has some intent, which is expressed to the computer in the form of the\nuser’s input. The computer reconciles this input with its own internal model and\noutputs the results. The user then perceives the changes, thinks about how they\ncompare to the original intent, and formulates a new action, which is expressed to\nthe computer through another input.\nF I G U R E\n
