Go watch someone unfamiliar with games—your mom, perhaps—try to play a game like Rad Racer. If it's a game which requires real-time control, she'll be leaning left and right in her chair, pulling the controller, trying to get the car to move just a bit farther, a bit faster. This feeling of steering—this tactile, visceral sensation—is game feel.",

Specifically, game feel is the tactile, kinesthetic sense of manipulating a virtual object. It's the sensation of control in a game.",

It's not hard to understand why; if a game designer's done his or her job correctly, the player will never notice the feel of a game. It will just seem right. In this sense, game feel is an \"invisible art,\" like cinematography. Feel is the most overlooked aspect of game creation; a powerful, gripping, tactile sensation that exists somewhere in the space between player and game.",

What struck me is just how compelling the game still is. It's easy to imagine the breathless enthusiasm of the young technicians crowding around their PDP-1 supercomputer, exhausting hours of valuable computing time on endless rounds of Steve Russell's creation. Even today, having played hundreds of games, it feels great to me to steer the little rockets, fire off missiles and avoid black holes. Game feel has been with us since the beginning.",

Understanding the physiological thresholds that cause game feel to be sustained or break down may help explain why frame rate drops and other technical disturbances make games feel so much worse. My hope is that in understanding and being able to measure things like frame rate and response time, you will be able to do a better job of separating medium from message. Yes, a developer is to blame if a game runs poorly. But I think this consideration is given too superlative an emphasis when games are critiqued. The experience of playing a game may still have some things to offer from a critical standpoint—as Jurassic Park: Trespasser did—even if they are technically incompetent.",

Why is one game \"floaty\" while another is \"tight and responsive\"? If a player tells me that my game is floaty, what should I do? This section is about measuring the pieces of the game feel process that a designer can change. By measuring each piece—input, response, context, polish, metaphor and rules—we can make generalizations about what terms like floaty, tight, smooth, responsive and loose mean. Not only in a particular game, but across different games. Once we can measure game feel, we can master it.",
