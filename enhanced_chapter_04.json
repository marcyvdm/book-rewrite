The player has a particular intent at a given moment in time, and he or she expresses that intent to the system via the input device. Whatever the input device is, it has affordances and constraints.

The completed processes have resulted in an updated system state for the computer, and it sends visual, aural and tactile feedback out through its various channels into the world and, as we looked at in Chapter 1, the position of the hands or other body parts on the input device offers the player proprioceptive feedback which can be reconciled with what's happening on the screen or coming through the speakers.

Ask yourself: if you didn't get a star for collecting 100 coins or if they did not restore Mario's health, would you bother collecting them? No, of course not. These are the arbitrary relationships between abstract variables that give coins meaning in the game world of Mario 64. The star itself is given meaning only by being rare and powerful, one of only 120 in the whole game, each of which is a clear, measurable step toward unlocking the entirety of the game's levels, the (explicit) goal of defeating Bowser or the (implicit) goal of collecting all the stars.",
