# Phase 5: Selective Refinement Procedure

## Overview
Post-mapping analysis to identify selective improvement opportunities that only become visible after full book processing.

## Step 1: Mapping Pattern Analysis
- Review all completed paragraph mappings
- Identify systematic issues across chapters
- Look for cumulative voice drift patterns
- Note information gaps revealed by full context

## Step 2: Refinement Candidate Identification  
Apply strict criteria to identify candidates:
```
if (informationLoss > 15% OR 
    voiceDrift > 25% OR 
    brokenCrossReferences OR
    confidenceImprovement > 10 points) {
  candidateForRefinement = true
}
```

## Step 3: Impact Prioritization
Rank refinement opportunities by:
1. Reader benefit impact
2. Processing cost
3. Risk of introducing new errors
4. Cascading update requirements

## Step 4: Surgical Refinement Execution
- Focus only on identified high-impact issues
- Maintain original mapping relationships
- Track changes with refinement metadata
- Update quality metrics

## Step 5: Validation
- Verify refinements actually improved quality
- Ensure no new errors introduced
- Update ProcessedBook with refinement history

## Success Metrics
- Average confidence score improvement
- Number of critical information recoveries
- Voice realignment corrections
- Cross-reference repairs completed
