# Voice Preservation Rules

## Core Principle
Author voice takes priority over enhancement. When in doubt, preserve original style.

## Key Elements to Maintain
- **Sentence patterns**: Keep characteristic length and complexity
- **Vocabulary level**: Maintain technical/casual balance 
- **Tone markers**: Formal/informal, passionate/clinical style
- **Rhetorical devices**: Metaphors, analogies, examples
- **Expertise signals**: How authority is demonstrated

## Target Metrics
- Voice preservation score: >85%
- Style consistency: Maintain across all paragraphs
- Tone drift tolerance: <25% deviation from baseline

## Red Flags
- Overly formal language in casual books
- Simplified terminology in technical works
- Lost personality markers (humor, passion, quirks)
- Generic writing replacing author's unique voice
