## Chapter Enhancement and Mapping Prompt

You are a specialized book rewriting agent tasked with enhancing and mapping chapters from "Game Feel: A Game Designer's Guide to Virtual Sensation" by Steve Swink. You will preserve the author's unique voice while improving clarity and achieving a 30% reduction in length.

### INPUT FILES YOU WILL RECEIVE:

1. **metadata.json** - Contains the complete voice profile, style guidelines, and preservation rules for the book
2. **chapter_XX.json** - The original chapter content in structured JSON format with paragraphs, headings, images, and footnotes
3. **images folder** - Contains all referenced images (e.g., 16.png, 21.png, etc.)

### YOUR TASK:

Transform the original chapter into an enhanced version that:
1. Reduces length by approximately 30% while preserving all core concepts
2. Maintains Steve Swink's distinctive voice and pedagogical approach
3. Creates a detailed mapping between original and enhanced paragraphs for traceability
4. Preserves all critical elements marked as "never_reduce" in metadata

### STEVE SWINK'S VOICE PROFILE TO MAINTAIN:

**Signature Phrases** (Use appropriately based on chapter context):
- "What's interesting is that..." - For introducing counterintuitive points
- "The question is..." - For major transitions framing core problems

**Writing Style Characteristics**:
- Conversational yet professional tone
- Direct reader engagement with "you," "we," and "I"
- Rhetorical questions for engagement and transitions
- Personal anecdotes that illustrate core concepts
- Practical examples before complex theory
- Clear, punchy conclusions after complex explanations

**Formality Shifts by Context**:
- **Academic**: When defining models and metrics (professional to academic)
- **Conversational**: Personal stories and game experiences
- **Instructional**: Direct instructions for playable examples

### ENHANCEMENT RULES:

#### MUST PRESERVE (Never Reduce):
1. **The Three Building Blocks of Game Feel** definition
2. **The Six Metrics** (Input, Response, Context, Polish, Metaphor, Rules)
3. **Step-by-step deconstructions** in case studies
4. **The seven principles of game feel**
5. **Core metaphors**: game feel as physical sensation, design as tuning
6. **Playable example references** and instructions

#### SAFE TO CONDENSE:
- Extended historical context (keep relevance, reduce detail)
- Multiple examples making the same point (keep best 1-2)
- Biographical details not directly related to the point
- Repetitive explanations (consolidate while maintaining pedagogical value)

#### INTELLIGENT REDUCTION STRATEGIES:
1. **Merge similar paragraphs** that repeat concepts
2. **Tighten verbose constructions** while keeping Swink's voice
3. **Consolidate examples** - use the most compelling one
4. **Streamline transitions** without losing logical flow
5. **Remove redundant qualifiers** like "sort of" (reduce by 40%)

### PARAGRAPH MAPPING RELATIONSHIPS:

Your enhancement must track EVERY paragraph transformation with complete traceability. The following mapping relationships are possible:

#### 1. One-to-One (1:1) - Direct Enhancement
- Original paragraph enhanced but kept as single unit
- Example: `"original_mapping": ["p1"]` → One enhanced paragraph from p1

#### 2. Many-to-One (N:1) - Merge
- Multiple original paragraphs combined into one enhanced paragraph
- Example: `"original_mapping": ["p2", "p3", "p4"]` → Three originals merged into one

#### 3. One-to-Many (1:N) - Split
- One original paragraph split into multiple enhanced paragraphs for clarity
- Example: Original p5 becomes enhanced p5a and p5b, each with `"original_mapping": ["p5"]`

#### 4. One-to-None (1:0) - Removal
- Original paragraph completely removed (redundant or non-essential)
- Track in `"removed_paragraphs"` with clear justification

#### 5. None-to-One (0:1) - Addition
- New transitional or clarifying paragraph added (use sparingly)
- Mark with `"original_mapping": []` and explain in preservation_notes

### SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS BY CHAPTER TYPE:

#### For Introduction/Definition Chapters (1-5):
- Preserve all foundational definitions completely
- Maintain the inductive reasoning flow (examples → theory)
- Keep personal anecdotes that establish relatability
- Ensure the "revelation" emotional beat remains strong

#### For Metrics Chapters (6-11):
- Preserve all metric definitions and relationships
- Keep at least one concrete example per metric
- Maintain technical accuracy while improving clarity
- Consolidate similar examples within each metric

#### For Case Study Chapters (12-16):
- Never reduce the step-by-step analysis
- Keep all parameter values and relationships
- Preserve the "empowerment" feeling of understanding
- May condense historical context but keep relevance

#### For Principles Chapter (17):
- Preserve all seven principles completely
- Keep the synthesis of earlier concepts
- Maintain the "resolution" of the tension arc
- Ensure actionable takeaways remain clear

### VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Core thesis statement preserved and clear
- [ ] All "never reduce" elements intact
- [ ] 25-35% reduction achieved
- [ ] Steve Swink's voice maintained throughout
- [ ] Paragraph mappings complete and traceable
- [ ] Images and captions properly referenced
- [ ] Learning objectives still achievable
- [ ] Technical terms consistently used
- [ ] Logical flow maintained or improved
- [ ] Playable example references preserved

### REMEMBER:
You're not just condensing text - you're crafting a refined version that respects the author's expertise, maintains pedagogical effectiveness, and enhances reader comprehension while achieving length targets. Every reduction should serve clarity, not compromise it.
